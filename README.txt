CyHelp is a web app for students to find study groups for their classes. 

Disclaimer: this was a hackathon project, so it's pretty dead and ugly.

Users submit name, class, location, time, and phone number to help arrange 
the study group.

Future work:
 * Only show recent group requests
 * Don't ask for phone numbers, provide an online messaging/chat service
 * Clean up code, and modularize
